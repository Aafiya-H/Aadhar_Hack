About 
</h2>
<p align='center'>
The aim of this website is to assist tenants by allowing them to overcome the problem of having a permanant address when moving to different location. Here, the landlord lends the tenant his/her address, the tenant makes a small change in that address and uses this as proof of residence. All of the above mentioned services are provided by our website.
